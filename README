This is a PyTorch implementation of probabilistic Convolutional Neural Network (pCNN) for uncertainty quantification of CO$_2$ plume migration in highly channelized aquifers with 
non-Gaussian permeability fields of geological carbon storage (GCS) projects. pCNN can provide reliable predictions and predictive uncertainties of CO$_2$ saturation fields and then 
be used in uncertainty quantification (UQ) of CO$_2$ plume migration in non-Gaussian permeability fields. It can also be applied to other multiphase flow problems 
concerning complex image-to-image regressions. The network architecture refers to the work of Zhu and Zabaras (2018)(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118302341).
