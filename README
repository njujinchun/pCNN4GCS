This is a PyTorch implementation of probabilistic Convolutional Neural Network (pCNN) for uncertainty quantification of CO$_2$ plume migrationreconstructing
the missing GRACE(-FO) TWSA fields of 2017-2018 from hydroclimatic predictors in an image-to-image (field-to-field) regression manner. It's revised after the repo of Dr. Yinhao Zhu. BCNN can be felxiblely applied to other problems involving complex image-to-image mappings.
