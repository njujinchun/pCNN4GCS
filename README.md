This is a PyTorch implementation of probabilistic Convolutional Neural Network (pCNN) for uncertainty quantification of $CO_2$ plume migration in highly channelized permeability fields of aquifers for geological carbon storage. pCNN can provide reliable predictions and predictive uncertainties of $CO_2$ saturation fields and then 
be used for repeated model runs in uncertainty quantification (UQ) of $CO_2$ plume migration in non-Gaussian permeability fields. It can also be applied to other multiphase flow problems 
concerning complex image-to-image regressions.
